### Course description:
Unit completed at UT Austin in 2018

* Programming language: 
  - **C++** 
* Unit length: 
  - **1 hour of lectures a week + assignments, for 1 semester**
* Material covered: 
  - **basics of C++ programming languages, including the syntax, standard template library (STL), and language- specific idioms.**
* Grade received:
  - **A-**
  
  
***I lost access to my source code for this course - It stayed at University Computers***  


### List of assignments:
1. **C++ basics & I/O** - The purpose of this assignment is to familiarize yourself with writing basic C++ code.
This assignment will cover simple I/O and writing functions.
2. **C++ classes & liblaries** - implementing C++ classes and the standard template library.
3. **C++ STL containers** - using Standard Template Liblary container classes and other basic C++ constructs.
4. **C++ streams** - You will implement a library of streams in C++. To make our library more usable, the stream class should be polymorphic: a user must be able to create a stream of any type. The assignment will help you get used to C++ templates.
5. **Final Project - Game** - implement a game similar to Atari breakout game.



### Note: I lost my code... somewhere. So this repository contains only assignment pdf documents with the exercises i've done for this module.
